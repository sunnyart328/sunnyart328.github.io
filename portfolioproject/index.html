         <p>My name is Sunniha Hussain, and I'm a senior at Fordham University Lincoln Center. Although I'm majoring in New Media and Digital Design, I'm interested in a variety of mindful activities such as creative writing, painting, and cooking. I hope to create works that reflect my passions and experiences. Below, you can view one of my favorite go-to wellness blogs to start off the day.</p>
